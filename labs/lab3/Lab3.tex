\chapter{Introduction}
During Lab 3 you will continue working with automated testing of Basic Melee Bot. You will still use the JUnit framework to drive the test automation, but your test design will leave the unit level to instead target robot behavior on the system level. To enable such testing, you will work with the Robocode plug-in RobotTestBed. Furthermore, you will design test cases to verify quality requirements regarding the battle performance of Basic Melee Bot. More specifically, Lab 3 covers:

\begin{itemize}
\item Working with the RobotTestBed plugin.
\item Designing JUnit test cases for system testing.
\item Designing JUnit test cases for testing quality requirements.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Before the lab}
The source code required for Lab 3 is available on GitHub:\\https://github.com/lunduniversity/introsofteng\\\\
If you have already cloned the repository, pull the latest source code to make sure you work with the latest version. If you prefer downloading the code, instead click the button presented in Figure~\ref{fig:github} and choose ``Download ZIP''. For Lab 3, you need the files located in introsofteng-master/project/rumble/labs/lab3/src, including its subfolder: `test'. Rewatch the video ``Lab2_download.avi'' on Google Drive (ETSA02 Everyone/Labs) if you need support.

\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{figures/GitHub.png}
\caption{introsofteng repository on GitHub. The arrow shows the ``Clone or download'' button.}
\label{fig:github}
\end{figure}

Follow these instructions to install the Robocode testing plugin:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the latest Robot testing plugin (1.9.3.1) from\\https://sourceforge.net/projects/robocode/files/robocode/1.9.3.1/
\item Add robocode.testing.jar to the Java build path of the project you created in Eclipse. Do this in the same way as when you added robocode.jar.
\item Create a new run configuration for JUnit with RobotTestBed. Do this in the same way as when creating a normal JUnit run configuration, but you must also add -Drobocode.home=$<$PATH TO ROBOCODE$>$ as an argument to the VM.
\end{enumerate}

To get an initial understanding of RobotTestBed, study the simple example TestWallBehavior that follows. The test case verifies that the corresponding robot visits all four corners of the battlefield. RobotTestBed introduces several methods that you can override to add JUnit assertions for testing robot behavior, most importantly:
\begin{itemize}
\item public void onBattleCompleted(BattleCompletedEvent event)
\item public void onRoundStarted(RoundStartedEvent event)
\item public void onRoundEnded(RoundEndedEvent event)
\item public void onTurnEnded(TurnEndedEvent event)
\end{itemize}

During the lab, you will work on designing test cases to verify the four primary features of Basic Melee Bot: 1) Spinning radar, 2) Closest enemy targeting, 3) Non-stop anti-gravity movement, and 4) Wall avoidance. Study the features and the corresponding detailed requirements of Basic Melee Bot in Section~\ref{sec:features}. Also study the quality requirements related to 1-vs-1 battle performance and melee battle performance.

\chapter{Basic Melee Bot Features and Quality Requirements} \label{sec:features}

\section{Feature 1 -- Spinning radar}
BMB shall feature a spinning radar.

\subsection{Description and Priority}
The spinning radar is a simple solution to detect enemy robots by continuously scanning the entire battlefield.\\\\Business priority: \textbf{high}\\
Implementation risk: \textbf{very low}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item[REQ-F1-1] The radar shall scan the battlefield clockwise as long as BMB is operational and the battle is ongoing.
\item[REQ-F1-2] Detected enemy robots shall be stored in an internal data structure. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Feature 2 -- Closest enemy targeting}
BMB shall target and shoot at the closest enemy robot.

\subsection{Description and Priority}
The rationale behind targeting and shooting at the closest enemy is that nearby robots are easier to hit. The solution is simple but useful.\\\\Business priority: \textbf{high}\\
Implementation risk: \textbf{low}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item[REQ-F2-1] BMB shall fire at the closest enemy robot as long as the battle is ongoing.
\item[REQ-F2-2] BMB shall use a constant fire power of 1.
\end{itemize}

\section{Feature 3 -- Non-stop anti-gravity movement}
BMB shall use anti-gravity movement.
	
\subsection{Description and Priority}
Anti-gravity movement is used to keep a distance to certain points on the battlefield. BMB shall use this movement to stay away from enemy robots. Furthermore, BMB shall never stay at one position.\\\\Business priority: \textbf{medium}\\
Implementation risk: \textbf{medium}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item[REQ-F3-1] BMB shall continuously move away from enemy robots.
\item[REQ-F3-2] BMB shall never stay in the same position for more than 10 consecutive turns.
\end{itemize}

\section{Feature 4 -- Wall avoidance}
BMB shall avoid driving into walls.

\subsection{Description and Priority}
Crashing into walls damages robots and forces them into a stop. BMB shall not end up in walls, even when the anti-gravity movement suggests such positions.\\\\Business priority: \textbf{medium}\\
Implementation risk: \textbf{medium}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item[REQ-F4-1] When closer than 40 distance units to a wall, BMB shall alter its course to avoid collision.
\end{itemize}

\section{Quality requirements}
TBD

\subsection{1-vs-1 battle performance}

\subsection{Melee battle performance}

\chapter{At the lab}

%Select your robot class in the Eclipse package explorer. Right-click and select new JUnit test case. Create the new test case. There are several naming conventions, e.g., using the same name as the class under test followed by the suffix `Test' and `Test' as prefix for all methods.
%Software-under-test is the normal name for the object to test, here we use bot-under-test.\\
%Introduce test driven development.

\chapter{After the lab}
%Reflect on what is important for successful team battles. Consider your two perspectives. First, think about what type of team you want to build to be run a successful LU rumble.
%
%Second, discuss what type of Robot you want to release on the market. What types will be in high demand? What is the competition going to offer? What could be your niche? Think about commodity, differentiation, and innovation.
%
%Successful development of software products for an open market requires making critical decisions under time pressure -- decisions of both technical nature as well as business nature. Your team needs to decide soon!
