\chapter{Introduction}
Lab 2 will inspire you to organize your the Robocode implementation according to a a proper object oriented design. Furthermore, Lab2 will help you get started with unit testing using the JUnit framework. More specifically, Lab 2 covers:

\begin{itemize}
\item Program comprehension, i.e., reading code of a somewhat more advanced robot.
\item Reading a UML class diagram.
\item Refactoring source code.
\item Working with JUnit in Eclipse.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Before the lab}
To save time during the lab session, please read through this section and follow the instructions.

Wikipedia is mostly a great source to read up on software engineering topics. Software engineers appear to carefully monitor and describe their work practices. Perhaps they take pride in describing what they do for the masses? Good for us, Wikipedia (at least in English) is a free an accurate source of software engineering knowledge. Besides, reading from other sources than the course book is a good idea.

Prior to the lab, please browse the following Wikipedia articles:

\begin{itemize}
\item Object oriented programming (skip ``History'' and onwards)\\-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
\item Class diagram\\-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram
\item Code refactoring\\-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring
\item Unit testing\\-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing
\end{itemize}

Create a run configuration for JUnit in Eclipse\\
Add -Drobocode.home=$<$PATH TO ROBOCODE$>$ as an argument to the VM\\
Might need to configure Eclipse project: Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Add Library -> JUnit -> Junit 5\\
Try running JUnit tests

\chapter{At the lab}
Initial steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the Lab 2 source code from GitHub:\\
https://github.com/lunduniversity/introsofteng/tree/master/project/rumble/labs/lab2/src
\item Create a new project in your Eclipse workplace. As in Lab 1, add the robocode.jar as an ``External JAR'' in the Libraries tab, either when creating the project or afterwards in the project properties.
\item In the ``Package Explorer'' pane, right click ``src'' and create a new ``Package'' called ``etsa02_lab''.
\item In the ``Package Explorer'' pane, right click the newly created package and run ``Import...''. Select ``File system'' and select all downloaded files in both the ``src'' folder and the ``src/test'' folder. The content in the Package Explorer should resemble Figure~\ref{fig:afterImport}.

\label{fig:afterImport}
\end{figure}
\item 
\end{enumerate}

The first task is to study the implementation

Select your robot class in the Eclipse package explorer. Right-click and select new JUnit test case. Create the new test case. There are several naming conventions, e.g., using the same name as the class under test followed by the suffix `Test' and `Test' as prefix for all methods.
Software-under-test is the normal name for the object to test, here we use bot-under-test.\\
Introduce test driven development.

%\section{Install Robocode}
%Download latest Robocode: https://sourceforge.net/projects/robocode/files/\\
%Install on local drive\\
%Start a few battles. Experiment.\\
%Develop a quick robot using the internal editor: http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/My_First_Robot\\
%Compile it and try it in battles.
%
%\section{Develop a Robot in Eclipse} \label{sec:develop}
%Create a project in Eclipse http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/Eclipse/Create_a_Project\\
%Download the Basic Leader Bot to the project. Make sure it builds.
%
%\section{Try the robot in Robocode} \label{sec:try}
%Add the Robot project in Robocode: http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/Add_a_Robot_Project\\
%Note: Add the path to the Eclipse project (with /src and /bin as sub-folders), not the workspace.
%
%\section{Configure Eclipse to run and debug the robot}
%Run from Eclipse: http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/Eclipse/Running_from_Eclipse\\
%Set up debugging from Eclipse: http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/Eclipse/Debugging_Robot
%
%\section{Expand the team} \label{sec:expand}
%Repeat the instructions in Sections~\ref{sec:develop}-\ref{sec:expand} for the Basic Bot and the Basic Drone.\\
%Create a team from within Robocode (Robot-$>$Create a robot team)\\
%Try a few team battles against various opposition.

\chapter{After the lab}
%Reflect on what is important for successful team battles. Consider your two perspectives. First, think about what type of team you want to build to be run a successful LU rumble.
%
%Second, discuss what type of Robot you want to release on the market. What types will be in high demand? What is the competition going to offer? What could be your niche? Think about commodity, differentiation, and innovation.
%
%Successful development of software products for an open market requires making critical decisions under time pressure -- decisions of both technical nature as well as business nature. Your team needs to decide soon!
